Recommended Tech Stack
Frontend:
React.js: For a modern, dynamic user interface.
Vite.js: For fast build times and development.
Axios: For making API calls to the backend.
Backend:
Flask or FastAPI: Lightweight Python frameworks, perfect for exposing your AI agentâ€™s functionality via RESTful APIs.
Uvicorn (if using FastAPI): For running the backend.
Hosting:
Frontend: Vercel (easy deployment of React apps).
Backend: Render or Railway (free plans available for small projects).

Additional Enhancements
Authentication: Use OAuth2 or JWT to secure the Groq API and frontend.
Real-Time Updates: Add WebSocket or polling to show updated recommendations.
Visualization: Display interactive portfolio data using D3.js or Plotly.


# Idea List
- Adding RAG based chat for content and messages -> historical context [More chatting and insights]
- Adding two README one for installation and demo 2nd for React agent basics
- Increasing size of stock profile json file -> or expand to use stock api instead -> a code => have to change risk mapping to file instead in recommend tool
- Expand and improve on system prompt
- Allow Graph fetching for stocks risk profile
- Change streamlit UI -> to show more queries => make detailed list about types of queries that could be passed for depending upon the level of challenge for the agent

#) Issues
- Observation sometimes go stray 
- Answer can be generated in ** format and secondly if there is new line in the Answer it doesn't display that
- Add a list of supported stocks
- Observation working to get the tool output is finicky, something to ensure that it is exact
- recommend_portfolio_adjustments system prompt is too generic and doesn't catch up the understanding that it should be picking the output from the tool result and not making it's own
- Adherence to the observation and rules is the issue.
- Double check the results generated in observation -> hallucinations
- Multi-step tool calling

#) Lessons
- Take basic Youtube video tutorial and make it your own with your own spin to it.
- It is important to finish a project -> rather than starting a new one, cause previous got too ambitious

- Remember to finish it as low-end product is better than keeping it unfinished
